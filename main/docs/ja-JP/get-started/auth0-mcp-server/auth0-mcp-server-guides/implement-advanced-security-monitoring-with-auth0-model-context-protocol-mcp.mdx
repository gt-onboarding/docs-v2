<Card title="Before you start">
  1. Create an Auth0 account with administrative access
  2. Install Auth0 MCP Server and integrate with Claude Desktop
</Card>

Leverage [Auth0 MCP Server](/docs/ja-JP/ja-jp/get-started/auth0-mcp-server) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to implement a sophisticated security monitoring and automated response system for your Auth0 tenant. Using natural language interactions, you can quickly set up security measures that would typically require complex scripting and dashboard navigation.

<div id="step-1-set-up-advanced-log-monitoring">
  ### 1: Set up advanced log monitoring
</div>

The first step in building a security monitoring system is to understand what normal authentication patterns look like in your environment. With Auth0 MCP Server, you can quickly analyze your logs to establish this baseline.

Ask Claude:

```python lines
Analyze my Auth0 logs from the past week to identify normal authentication patterns. Look for common IP ranges, devices, browsers, and time-of-day patterns.
```

Claude will use the `auth0_search_logs` tool to retrieve and analyze your logs. This analysis gives you a baseline understanding of normal authentication patterns, which is essential for identifying anomalies.

<div id="step-2-create-security-detection-actions">
  ### 2: Create security detection Actions
</div>

Now that you understand normal patterns, you can create Actions that detect suspicious activities. Instead of writing complex code manually, you can describe the security rules in natural language.

Ask Claude:

```lines
Create an action that detects the following suspicious activities:
1. Multiple failed login attempts within a short time period
2. Logins from unusual geographic locations for a user
3. Logins at unusual times based on the user's history
4. Rapid account switching from the same IP address
```

Claude will use the `auth0_create_action` tool to generate and create an Action with sophisticated detection logic.

<div id="step-3-create-automated-response-actions">
  ### 3: Create automated response Actions
</div>

After you have detection in place, next you&#39;ll need to create Actions that respond to detected threats. These Actions will implement your security policies based on the risk level.

Ask Claude:

```lines
Create an action that responds to security threats based on risk score:
1. For low risk (score < 30), allow the login but log the event
2. For medium risk (score 30-60), require additional verification like MFA
3. For high risk (score > 60), block the login and notify security team
```

Claude will use the `auth0_create_action` tool again to create a response Action.

<div id="step-4-deploy-the-security-actions">
  ### 4: Deploy the security Actions
</div>

With your security Actions created, you need to deploy them in the correct sequence to ensure they work together properly.

Ask Claude:

```lines
Deploy the security detection action first, followed by the response action. They should run in sequence during the login flow.
```

Claude will use the `auth0_deploy_action` tool twice to deploy both Actions in the correct order.

<div id="step-5-create-custom-security-challenge-forms">
  ### 5: Create custom security challenge Forms
</div>

For medium-risk logins that require additional verification, you&#39;ll want to create a custom [Form](/docs/ja-JP/ja-jp/customize/forms) that explains the situation to the user.

Ask Claude:

```lines
Create a custom form for additional security verification that explains to the user why additional verification is needed and provides clear instructions.
```

Claude will use the `auth0_create_form` tool to create a custom Form. After creating the Form, publish it with the `auth0_publish_form` tool.

Ask Claude:

```lines
Publish the form to my tenant
```

<div id="step-6-monitor-security-events">
  ## Step 6: Monitor security events
</div>

To ensure your security system is working effectively, you need to monitor security events and analyze patterns.

Ask Claude:

```python lines
Show me all high-risk security events from the past 24 hours, and identify any patterns or trends, using score-based categorization.
```

Claude will use the `auth0_list_logs` tool with specific criteria to find security events.

<div id="step-7-fine-tune-the-security-system">
  ## Step 7: Fine-tune the security system
</div>

Based on your monitoring, you may need to fine-tune your security system to reduce false positives or address specific threats.

Ask Claude:

```python lines
Update the security detection action to be more sensitive to logins from Russia and China, and less sensitive to unusual login times for users in the IT department.
```

Claude will use `auth0_get_action` to retrieve the current Action code, then use `auth0_update_action` to modify it. After updating the Action, deploy it with `auth0_deploy_action`.

Ask Claude:

```lines
Deploy the action to my tenant.
```

<div id="conclusion">
  ## Conclusion
</div>

By using Auth0 MCP Server with Claude, you&#39;ve implemented a sophisticated security monitoring and response system by:

* Setting up advanced threat detection based on user behavior patterns
* Creating intelligent response mechanisms that adapt to different risk levels
* Implementing custom security challenges for suspicious logins
* Establishing a monitoring system to track security events
* Fine-tuning your security rules based on real-world data

This natural language approach not only saves time but also allows you to implement security best practices without deep expertise in Auth0&#39;s Actions system or log query syntax.
